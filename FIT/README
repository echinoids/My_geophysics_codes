Physics of the Earth's interior:

-Accretion model of planets (differential equation systems solution using Euler's method)
-Non-linear fitting of plate deflection under an end load using objective function minimization.
-Viscoelasticity models (Maxwell, Kelvin-Voigt and Zener).
-Geothermal energy and convection.

All codes presented above are written in spanish and codified in python.
