# Geophysics codes <br/>

*Simple Python codes made by students of UNLP (AR) - Geophysics.<br/>
*I want to thank Orianna Rangel for all the support in many of the codes presented here.<br/>
*These codes are just for helping others to understand basics of applied geophysics in simple tasks.<br/>
*These codes should be optimized, although I present here a raw version.<br/>
