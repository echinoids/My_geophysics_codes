# My_geophysics_codes

*Simple Python codes made by students of UNLP (AR) - Geophysics.
*I want to thank Orianna Rangel for all the support in many of the codes presented here.
*These codes are just for helping others to understand basics of applied geophysics in simple tasks.
*These codes should be optimized, although I present here a raw version.
