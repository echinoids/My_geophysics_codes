Potential methods' codes:

-Upward and downward continuation applied to gravity data.
-Polinomial regression applied to gravity data.
-Butterworth filter applied to magnetic data.
-Derivative filters applied to magnetic data.
-Steepest descent algorithm applied to gravity data (credits to Cartagena, Tomás; Ramírez, Stephany y Rangel, Orianna).
-Correlation between height data and free air anomaly data.
-Nettleton method to calculate density.
-Magnetic response of a spherical body.

All the codes above are written in spanish and codified in python.
